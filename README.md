# From Zero to AWS

## What this is

This is meant to be a series of self-starting courses that anyone can take on to upskill in AWS. Starting from basics, we'll unpack each domain until you have an intermediate understanding of how AWS works, how to work with it, and how to set up an infrastructure for a modern system.

## What you'll need

To go through this course, you'll need:

1.) An AWS Account. 

2.) (If using a Mac) an SSH client like iTerm or Terminal

3.) (If using Windows) an SSH client like PuTTY
