# SSH access from Windows 

Unfortunately, the best SSH client for Windows also requires its own format. So the Windows steps will have two parts: A.) Generating the key, and B.) Using the key

## Generate the key

### 1.) Go to the Putty webpage

Open up your browser and go to: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

### 2.) Download PuTTY

Right-click and *Save As* the links for the latest installer. As of time of writing, it's **putty-0.67-installer.msi**

### 3.) Run the installer

Execute the MSI file, and go through the installation. It should install a couple of programs, but we only need two: *PuTTY* and *PuTTYGen*

### 4.) Start PuTTYGen

From the *Start* menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYGen**.

Under **Type of key to generate**, select **SSH-2 RSA**.

### 5.) Load your Key Pair

Click on **Load**. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension `.ppk`. To locate your .pem file, select the option to display *All Files*. 

Go to the directory where you downloaded your Key Pair, open the file, and click on *Open*.

### 6.) Save your private key

Choose **Save private key** to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose *Yes*.

### 7.) Name your key

Specify the same name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, `banana-smith-keypair`)


## Logging in

### 1.) Start PuTTY 

From the Start menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**

### 2.) Set your login

In the *Category* pane, select **Session** and complete the following fields:


```
 Host: ec2-user@[PUBLIC IP]
 Port: 22
 Connection type: SSH
```

Make sure you replace *[PUBLIC IP]* with the *Public IP* of your EC2 instance. For example: 

```
 Host: ec2-user@22.33.44.55
 Port: 22
 Connection type: SSH
```


### 3.) Select your key file

In the *Category* pane, expand **Connection**, expand **SSH**, and then select **Auth**.

Click on **Browse**. Select the `.ppk` file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose **Open**.

### 4.) Save your session

In the *Category* pane, select **Session**. Enter a name for the session under **Saved Sessions**.

Choose **Save**.

### 5.) Login!

Finally, that's all done. Click on **Open** to start the SSH session - it will display a security alert that you can safely ignore (at least for this session).
